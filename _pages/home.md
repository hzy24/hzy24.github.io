I am dedicated to developing interpretable machine learning and artificial intelligence models to extract physical insights and generate new hypotheses from vast astronomical datasets. 

My research interests lie in data‚Äêdriven discovery in astrophysics, with a particular focus on uncovering the fundamental physical principles hidden within the data itself.
