<p style="overflow-wrap:anywhere; word-break:break-word; hyphens:auto;">
Dedicated to developing a new language—interpretable Artificial Intelligence—to decipher the new 'book of nature' written in vast astronomical data. My goal is to help shift the paradigm in astrophysics from model-driven verification to data-driven discovery, uncovering the fundamental physics hidden within the data itself.
